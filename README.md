# Building Robust Neuroscience Experiments with Python and PsychoPy


## Outline
The course takes three days, each day consists of four sessions, each session takes about 1.5 hours.
A Markdown notebook for each session can be found in the folder for the respective day.
The notebooks contain exercises and their solution is stored in the solutions folder.
